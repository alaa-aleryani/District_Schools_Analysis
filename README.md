# Pandas Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities in our city school district.

As a first task, we've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We were given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Our task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


## Note: 
In this challenge we were provided with PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb, and I built it from there
to get the final analysis which you will find in main_script.ipynb
